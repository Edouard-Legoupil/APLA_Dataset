# APLA_Dataset
Data for the replication of the paper The Asylum Policies in Latin America (APLA) Database: Findings from an Expanded Methodology to Study Refugee Policies in Latin America, 1990-2018

The APLA_Paper RMD file contains the replication code for all the graphs and charts of the paper. 

Data_APLA contains data that includes APLA's regulatory complexity and liberalisation scores, as well as a number of relevant variables that are used in further research. 

Data_APLA_1 and Data_APLA_Maps are slightly modified versions of the dataset above, which allows to better plot, map or chart certain variables. 

APLA Database.xlx is the original APLA Dataset.
